## UPDATE on Research and Leadership

This biannual publication from the Office of Community College Research and Leadership (OCCRL) features articles on programs, policies, and research that highlight transitions toward, through and out of postsecondary education.

**OCCRL and Our Mission**

Established in 1989 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, OCCRL is an initiative of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership in the College of Education. Projects within the office are supported by the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) and the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), along with other state, federal, private and nonprofit organizations. The content within OCCRLâ€™s publications does not necessarily represent the positions or policies of our sponsors or the University of Illinois.
The UPDATE is prepared pursuant to a grant from ICCB (state award identification number AH165).
Our mission is to use research and evaluation methods to improve policies, programs and practices to enhance community college education and transition to college for diverse learners at the state, national and international levels.
Please send inquiries or comments to OCCRL at occrl@illinois.edu or call 217-244-9390.
We encourage you to sign up for our biweekly newsletter, Network News.
