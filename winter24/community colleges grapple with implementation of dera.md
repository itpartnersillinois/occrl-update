## Introduction

Illinois community colleges continue to innovate amid legislative changes and a recent shift in administering developmental education prompted by the Developmental Education Reform Act (DERA). Developmental education aims to support students with diverse needs and strengthen math, reading, and writing skills in preparation for college-level courses. However, racially minoritized students are disproportionately placed in development education courses and at lower levels, often requiring them to complete multiple pre-college courses (Brown, 2022; Chen & Simone, 2016). Researchers note that this placement creates greater equity gaps among students. Scholarship indicates that many community college students will test into developmental education courses, particularly in mathematics and language skills, for college-level coursework (Chen & Simone, 2016; Jaggars & Bickerstaff, 2018). In 2014, nearly half of the community college students in Illinois were placed into a developmental education course (Abrahamson & Power, 2024). 

Illinois enacted DERA as part of Illinois HB 2170, passed by the Illinois General Assembly and signed into law by Governor JB Pritzker in March of 2021 (110 ILCS 175/ Developmental Education Reform Act, 2021). DERA mandates that all 48 community colleges in Illinois reform their course placement evaluation to use a multiple-measure placement framework. The goal of DERA is to create equitable pathways for historically excluded students by considering a variety of metrics for holistic assessment of students’ abilities. This approach redirects students away from non-credit development coursework and modifies curriculum practices to include a co-requisite model.

**Karen Tabb Dina and David Huang, College of Education, have been collaborating on perinatal mental health research since 2017, when the two received their first Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) award.**

## The Power of Interdisciplinary Problem Solving

“Dr. Huang always brings his expertise in decisionmaking science, implementation science, and group process,” said Tabb Dina. “I just help people make decisions. A lot of the finesse as a social worker is going into a hospital system and saying, ‘This is a problem, your data says it’s a problem.’ Dr. Huang and I complement each other nicely.”

Huang agrees, noting that he and Tabb Dina share a deep interest in addressing “emerging needs from underrepresented populations and communities.”

“Collectively, we’re contributing to the Pathways project with interdisciplinary perspectives proven by our prior collaborations,” said Huang.

## Training the Next Generation of Engaged Researchers

As part of Pathways at Illinois, PCORI is funding one young faculty scholar to come in and work with real patients and professionals to learn more about these issues and how to prioritize them in their research. Tabb Dina and Huang are also establishing a mentorship network for additional scholars, to bring these perinatal mental health issues into focus and train the next generation of engaged researchers – especially faculty who are underrepresented minorities

Throughout the process, Tabb Dina and Huang will work closely with researchers at three other institutions participating in the Pathways program: UMass Chan Medical School, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences, and University of Colorado.
