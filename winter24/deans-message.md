# Dean’s Message{.no-bottom-margin}

Connection is the catalyst for positive momentum. The success of Education at Illinois—and the field of education—relies on building and maintaining strong partnerships.

Authentic connection is the product of great effort and intention, like the work we are excited to highlight in this **2024 Impact Report**.

We proudly welcome 16 new tenure system and specialized faculty members to the College this year, providing expanded capacity for research collaboration and graduate student mentoring.

The College’s innovative programs and unmatched student experiences are connecting with the next generation of education leaders, as evidenced by our historic 2024 enrollment. We have the largest first-year student undergraduate class in 50 years, a testament to the excellence of our programs and the value they bring to our local, national, and international classrooms and educational workforce. We look forward to the creativity and insight these students’ endeavors will bring to our campus and beyond.

Connection to underserved communities through teaching and service is a given for most educators, and the College’s commitment to community engagement goes above and beyond. We understand our university’s enduring land grant mission to serve the people of Illinois—and make it our mission to be connected and responsive to all groups of people.

I look forward to staying connected with you over the coming year, and to leading the innovation, discovery, momentum, and community that drives our College and the University of Illinois forward.

Yours in Orange & Blue,

**Chrystalla Mouza**
Dean, College of Education

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign sits on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community inclusive of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our efforts.
